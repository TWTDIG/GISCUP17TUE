### Giscup 2017 entry from TU Eindhoven
This is the code as submitted for the competition, with a bit of additional documentation.

Code can be compiled using "compile_g++.sh", or visual studio.

Code contains small memory leak, and should not be considered stable or correct. A better implementation will follow soon.

The file "settings.h" contains various tweaks, some only work on windows/linux.

The file "performance.txt" contains runtime info for "queries.txt" and "dataset.txt".
